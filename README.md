# Classification_AI
A project practicing classification methods on the dataset MNIST! This was alot of fun and I am very excited to continue practicing. I will be uploading a second practice on classification to make my method more accurate, currently I have gotten about 92% precision with a 85% recall. I would like to get the precision at least to 95%!
